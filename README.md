 How to do an IDP (Individual development plan)

 

Plan for next 1/2 years (keep the long term goal in mind)

 

Have a goal (this is not a designation, this is a role)
Clearly understand the roles and responsibilities of that role
Write down the skills required for the next role (to be role)
Do a SWOT analysis
Check which areas you need improvements
Write down your plan (mention ETAs/quantify plan items) â€“ keep following up to achieve
Important: you should not plan to allocate lot of time for your plan. It will not happen if you have a big plan. Especially if you are already filled up with work. (delegate work to make space)
